# playing-with-spring-boot

In this demo project we seen how to build some simple REST services with Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA on the persistence layer, and Java 8.
In adition, we seen how much simplification brings Spring Boot in terms of configuration and make an app ready to run.
To get it even easier we used Spring initializr, https://start.spring.io/  to get a preconfigured Spring Boot app, with a few starters.
